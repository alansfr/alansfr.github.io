# Lakes Voters Decree More Of The Same

LAUDERDALE LAKES â€” For at least the next year, it appears to be business as usual in Lauderdale Lakes.

Incumbents Mac Klein, Lou Tenner and Harry Rosenkrantz easily retained their seats Tuesday, beating first-time candidates Glenn Greenwald and Alfonso Scott Junious.

**Klein grabbed 3,410 votes; Rosenkrantz 3,144 votes; Tenner 3,100 votes; Greenwald 720 votes; Junious 436 votes.**

Only the top three gained two-year council terms. The balance of the six- member council, as well as the mayor, are up for re-election next year.

A Lauderdale Lakes incumbent hasn`t lost since 1976.

"We can continue to serve the needs of the citizens of Lauderdale Lakes in a caring and prudent manner", Klein said.

"It\`s gratifying to receive such great support for my candidacy," Klein said. "It\`s also disappointing to find so much voter apathy."

He said only about one-fourth of the voters cast ballots.

Councilman Tenner said, "We\`re going to continue to service the people like always and we`re going to make sure that we maintain the best quality of life for all citizens."

Rosenkrantz thanked all the people who voted for him and said he would "continue to address the problems of the city and try and solve them."

Junious said he expected the results of his campaigning "to be a bit better. I didn`t think I would come in fifth place."




Junious said the city`s at-large election favored the incumbents because they all live in the largest condominium complex in the city -- Hawaiian Gardens -- and are heavily supported by those voters.

**Greenwald, an 18-year-old candidate, said he was "disappointed a little bit" in not winning a seat.  
"I think a large part (of the loss) was due to my age."**
