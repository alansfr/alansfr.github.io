# Credibility of BetterCallGlenn articles

Some of the the allegations made on the Brazilian Web Site _BetterCallGlenn_ in 2019 naturally provoke skepticism, and without some further evidence might be dismissed as far-fetched. It is possible the authors - who appear to have interviews certainly key players - had access to such evidence but they did not reveal it.


However the articles are full of many unusual background details which are not publicly known, going far beyond the 2013   _NY Daily News_ [article](/sobstack/) and in places contradicting it.

The details are specific enough that if they were pure invention one would expect some to be disprovable. Some are also so unusual that, if accurate, they are highly unlikely to be the result of mere lucky guesswork.

We have found strong supporting evidence for many of these details, in some cases quite conclusive.


## Non-public Background informaiton in BetterCallGlenn allegations.



| Assertion Made | Evidence | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Employed undocumented immigrants  with poor English, taking advantage of them | Max. "Drop the Minder" | Likely |  |
| Some Workers were engaged on an ongoing basis rather than the norm of one-off porn scenes. Work included other more general commerical sexual activity(\"erotic experiments\") | Max | Proven |  |
| Extensively into heavy bondage S/M | Reference to keeping slaves | Conclusive | |
| Glenn demanded to be called by an assumed **master** name, specifially Herr Dom or DomMascHry31 | Some evidence in M4M chat including DomBrazHry27 | Some supporting evidence | |
| Commericial offerings involved Cam sex perfomances under Glenn's directed | [Advertised on HSV](/assets/images/TuckerChat.png) | Proven | Highly Unusual |
| Glenn blackmailed Peter Haas | None specific, for or against | Unproven | |
| Greenwald dressed as an SS General | Obsession with keeping sex slaves and clearly advertising through discreet channels; also painting of Glenn in military uniform (but not SS) exists, which seems odd | Unproven. Mild evidence in favor |  |
| Glenn sometimes referred to his performers as slaves | M4M chat | Proven | Highly unusual |
| Commerical activities involved violent, non-consensual, sex | hinted at in M4M forums  and theme is present in some porn output from NYC and Sauna Boys 3 | Considerable | |
| Sexual obsession with Nazis | No direct evidence, but Glenn was definitely a Nazi defender. Also allegedly claimed by another witness |
| Glenn was a terrifying monster but sometimes \"practiced sex being dominated and passive\" |  Supported by DataLounge gossip, independent | Plausible |  |
| Clients for the business were found in chat rooms | admitted by Glenn in Hairwire of M4M | very strong support | |
| Glenn's aim in Rio in early 2005 was to find Studmall actors | Video output in Mid-2005 | Proven beyonnd a doubt | not at all what Glenn told _NY Daily News_ |
| Glenn felt he would struggle in Rio in 2005 with full-time assistance of a trustworhy assistant who could recruit and blend in | Very very plausible, but something only a gay gringo would know, unlikely to have been invented by a BCG journalist | Strong evidence this wasn't casually invented but not consistent with having David's full-time support guaranteed | |
