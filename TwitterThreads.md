# About

__Twitter on Glenn is not at all the same thing as Glenn on Twitter.__

This is the former.

Links to some relevant Twitter threads. Expect more to be added here very soon.
_They do not necessarily link to the start of the thread. If a thread bifurcates a lot, it is sometimes much easier to link to the end and let the reader work backwards._
