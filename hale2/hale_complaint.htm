Now comes Plaintiff Matthew F. Hale, by and through his attorneys, and alleges
as and for his complaint against defendants, alternatively and/or conjunctively,
as follows:
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><u><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="36">
</SPACER>
STATEMENT OF THE CASE</u></b>
<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
</SPACER>
1.&nbsp;The denial of Matthew Hale's application to practice law in the State of
Illinois embodies the most egregious -- and most dangerous -- constitutional
abuses which have, again and again, been resoundingly declared by courts in this
Nation to be patently unlawful. In sum, Hale, a well-known and vigorous advocate
of racist and anti-Semitic ideas, was barred from the legal profession and
denied his livelihood because the individuals sitting on the Committee of
Character and Fitness for the State of Illinois happened to disagree -- strongly
-- with Hale's political and religious views. To describe the denial of Hale's
application to practice law, then, is to illustrate the profound dangers it
poses to the most basic and valued liberties guaranteed to all citizens by the
United States Constitution.
<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
</SPACER>
2.&nbsp;Matthew Hale graduated from law school and passed the Bar Examination of
the State of Illinois. Despite these achievements, Hale, on June 30, 1999, was
denied a license to practice law by the Committee on Character and Fitness for
the State of Illinois, by the Board of Admissions to the Bar, and by its
individual members -- <u>not</u> because of any misconduct in which he engaged,
but rather, because the political and religious views espoused by Hale, and his
practice of privately discriminating on the basis of race and religion, led the
defendants to conclude that Hale lacked the requisite &quot;character and
fitness&quot; to practice law. The Committee's denial of Hale's application
based on these grounds wilfully and recklessly violated the rights of freedom of
statement, freedom of association, due process of law, and equal protection
under the law which are guaranteed to all citizens of this Nation, including
Hale, by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
Defendants' conduct therefore violated Hale's rights, privileges and immunities
secured by the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. * 1983.
<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
</SPACER>
3.&nbsp;Independent of the denial of Hale's specific application, both the
substance and procedure of the Rules governing the admissions process are
plainly unconstitutional on their face. Specifically, those Rules:
<ul>
  <p>*&nbsp;bar an applicant from receiving a law license who, <u>in his/her
  private life</u>, racially discriminates -- a clear violation of the First
  Amendment's freedom of association;
  <ul>
    <p>*&nbsp;bar an applicant who <u>advocates</u>&nbsp;racial discrimination
    from practicing law -- a clear violation of the First Amendment guarantee of
    free statement;
    <ul>
      <p>*&nbsp;permit an applicant to be denied a license to practice law
      without providing the applicant an opportunity to have constitutional
      challenges to that denial be actually heard or adjudicated by a court that
      has jurisdiction to do so -- a clear violation of the Fourteenth
      Amendment's guarantee of due process of law.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      4.&nbsp;But for the patent constitutional abuses of the Committee on
      Character and Fitness and its individual members, Matthew Hale would be
      practicing law in Illinois today. Independently, but for the facially
      unconstitutional procedural and substantive rules governing the admissions
      process, Hale would be practicing law in Illinois today. &nbsp;The members
      of the Committee on Character and Fitness, acting under color of law,
      knowingly and/or recklessly violated Matthew Hale's constitutional rights
      to free statement, free association, due process of law, and equal
      protection. Hale is thus entitled to compensatory damages, punitive
      damages, and the declaratory and injunctive relief sought herein.</p>

      </SPACER>
      5.&nbsp;Plaintiff Matthew F. Hale is a resident of the State of Illinois
      who, at all relevant times herein, resided in East Peoria, Illinois. In
      1998, Hale graduated Southern Illinois University at Carbondale School of
      Law with a Juris Doctor degree, and thereafter sat for and passed the
      State of Illinois' Bar examination conducted in the summer of 1998.
      Despite his law school degree and successful Bar examination, Hale was
      denied a licence to practice law in Illinois by the Board of Admissions,
      the Committee of Character and Fitness, and its individual members, on
      June 30, 1999, when they purportedly concluded that Hale did not possess
      the requisite character and fitness to practice law in the State of
      Illinois.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">

      6.&nbsp;Defendant Committee on Character and Fitness of the State of
      Illinois is a committee appointed pursuant to Rule 708 of the Illinois
      Supreme Court Rules, and operates pursuant to Rule 4 of the Illinois Rules
      of Procedure for the Board of Admissions and Committee on Character and
      Fitness. Pursuant to these Rules, the Committee determines whether an
      applicant possesses the requisite character and fitness for admission to
      the practice of law. Upon the Committee's certification that the applicant
      possesses the requisite character and fitness, the Board of Admissions to
      the Bar, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 708, will admit the applicant to
      practice law in Illinois. Absent the Committee's certification, the Board
      of Admissions to the Bar, pursuant to Rule 708, will deny the applicant
      the right to practice law in Illinois.

      7.&nbsp;Defendant Board of Admissions to the Bar is a panel which,
      pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 702, oversees the administration of all
      aspects of the bar admissions process, including the assessment of each
      candidate's character and fitness to practice law in Illinois. The Board
      of Admissions administratively implements the Committee's decision
      regarding whether an applicant possesses the requisite character and
      fitness to practice law in Illinois.

      Rule 708 of the Illinois Supreme Court Rules, and operates pursuant to
      Rule 4 of the Illinois Rules of Procedure for the Board of Admissions and
      the Character and Fitness Committee. Pursuant to these Rules, the
      Committee determines whether applicants within the Third Judicial District
      possess the requisite character and fitness for admission to the practice
      of law. Upon the Committee's certification that the applicant possesses
      the requisite character and fitness, the Board of Admissions to the Bar,
      pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 708, will admit the applicant to practice
      law in Illinois. Absent the Committee's certification, the Board of
      Admissions to the Bar, pursuant to Rule 708, will deny the applicant the
      right to practice to practice law in Illinois.

      FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS</u></b>
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      19.&nbsp;Plaintiff Hale is a graduate of Southern Illinois University at
      Carbondale School of Law. Hale graduated in 1998 with a J.D. degree. Hale
      then took and passed the Illinois State Bar Examination and, having
      completed all requirements for admission to practice law in Illinois,
      applied for admission in the Summer of 1998. There were no incidents of
      misconduct in Hale's past to justify denial of Hale's application to
      practice law.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      20.&nbsp;The Committee on Character and Fitness and the Board of
      Admissions denied Hale's application on the ground that the political and
      religious views he holds are so disagreeable that those views, by
      themselves, render him unfit to practice law. As the Committee, in denying
      his application, reasoned: &quot;Mr. Hale's long standing and strongly
      held <u>beliefs</u> are in absolute contradiction to the letter and
      spirit&quot; of the Rules of Professional Conduct. In light of these
      views, the Committee predicted that, as a result of the political and
      religious <u>beliefs</u> he espouses, he &quot;will quickly run
      afoul&quot; -- in the future -- of the rules governing attorney conduct.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      21.&nbsp;The denial of Hale's application to practice law based on the
      grounds that his political and religious beliefs render him unfit violates
      numerous core constitutional rights. The constitutional rights which
      defendants' conduct so plainly violates are among the most clearly
      established and long standing constitutional liberties -- liberties which
      lie at the heart of this Nation's democracy. The violation of Hale's
      rights by defendants was wilful and reckless, and therefore violative of
      42 U.S.C. * 1983.
      <p><b><u>Background of Hale's application to practice law</u></b>
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      22.&nbsp;Hale is, and since 1996 has been, the &quot;Pontifex Maximus,&quot;
      or Supreme Leader, of The World Church of the Creator (&quot;WCOTC&quot;),
      an avowedly racist and anti-Semitic church which espouses White Separatist
      views. As part of his leadership of the WCOTC, Hale has become a
      well-known advocate of racism and anti-Semitism, and has written numerous
      articles, given countless speeches, and regularly appeared on television
      shows and in the written media advocating and disseminating his and the
      WCOTC's racist and anti-Semitic ideas.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      23.&nbsp;Hale does not conceal or dilute his views. As part of the
      application process to become authorized to practice law in Illinois, he
      candidly acknowledged that he fervently believes in the ideas he advocates
      and does not intend to abandon them. He further acknowledged that he --
      like many citizens -- stands firmly opposed to many laws and rules,
      including certain constitutional amendments, which the majority of the
      population favors.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      24.&nbsp;Regardless of these opinions, Hale, from the beginning of the
      admissions process, repeatedly affirmed his ability and intent to comply
      with all rules and laws governing the conduct of an attorney, regardless
      of whether he agreed or disagreed with such rules and laws. Moreover,
      while candidly disclosing his intent, via advocacy and persuasion, to
      bring about the repeal of laws with which he disagrees, he unequivocally
      committed to abide by all laws and rules as written and/or as courts
      interpreted and applied them.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      25.&nbsp;Hale's commitment to adhere to all applicable laws and rules in
      the future was bolstered by his past. Unlike many applicants who are
      admitted to practice law in the State of Illinois despite a history of
      criminal behavior, Hale has no criminal record. Indeed, as the Inquiry
      Panel of the Committee on Character and Fitness found, Hale demonstrated
      &quot;an absence of criminal conduct . . . by clear and convincing
      evidence.&quot;
      <p><b><u>The Inquiry Panel's Recommendation</u></b>
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      26.&nbsp;Pursuant to Rule 5.1(a) of the Rules of Procedure of the Board of
      Admissions and the Committee on Character and Fitness for the State of
      Illinois (the &quot;Rules of Procedure&quot;), Hale's application was, in
      the first instance, referred to a single member of the Third District
      Committee for consideration. After reviewing the application, that member
      advised the Illinois Board of Admissions that he was not prepared to
      recommend that Hale be admitted to practice law in Illinois.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      27.&nbsp;Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 5.2(a) of the Rules of Procedure,
      the Chairperson of the Third District Committee assigned Hale's
      application to a three-person &quot;Inquiry Panel&quot; for further
      review, examination, and ultimately, the issuance of a recommendation to
      the Committee as to whether or not Hale was fit to practice law.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      28.&nbsp;On December 16, 1998, in a 2-1 written Decision, the Inquiry
      Panel recommended that the Committee withhold Hale's admission to practice
      law in Illinois. The Inquiry Panel candidly admitted that &quot;the
      reasons for [its] decision relate to the applicant's active advocacy of
      his core beliefs.&quot;
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      29.&nbsp;Indeed, the Inquiry Panel, in refusing to recommend Hale for
      admission to practice law, expressly acknowledged that: &quot;The easiest
      resolution of Mr. Hale's application is to certify him. <u>This would be
      in accord with the view that the First Amendment is virtually absolute.</u>&quot;
      Despite its apparent recognition that unwavering application of the First
      Amendment would compel Hale's admission to practice law, the Inquiry Panel
      -- after lengthy philosophical discussions regarding why the majority of
      the Inquiry Panel believe Hale's political and religious views to be
      misguided and &quot;irrational&quot; -- concluded that, <u>by virtue of
      these views</u>, Hale was not fit to practice law.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      30.&nbsp;Appallingly and unconstitutionally -- but also revealingly -- the
      Inquiry Panel outright <u>admitted</u> that its recommendation to deny
      Hale's application was based on its belief that it was entitled to place <u>its</u>
      &quot;preference for antidiscriminatory values <u>over the First
      Amendment.</u>&quot; Indeed, the Inquiry Panel went so far as to admit
      that while Hale was &quot;free&quot; to &quot;incite as much racial hatred
      as he desires . . . he cannot do this as an officer of the court.&quot;
      The Inquiry Panel further explained its recommendation not to certify Hale
      by expressing its opposition to Hale's purported desire to submit
      &quot;fundamental rights&quot; to majority vote, and by condemning Hale's
      admiration for Adolph Hitler.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      31.&nbsp;The Inquiry Panel concluded its recommendation by excerpting a
      passage from the historian William L. Shirer relating to the treatment of
      Jews in Nazi Germany, and then reasoned that -- while &quot;merely holding
      private theoretical beliefs favoring either [destruction of the Bill of
      Rights or overthrow of the government] is not a legal basis for
      disqualifying a bar applicant&quot; -- Hale does not merely <u>believe</u>,
      but also actively <u>advocates</u> such views. As a result of his <u>advocacy</u>
      of these views, the Inquiry Panel recommended that Hale should not be
      admitted to practice law in Illinois.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      32.&nbsp;That the Inquiry Panel's recommendation is replete with
      expressions of the political beliefs of the majority of its members, and
      that it is comprised almost exclusively of a refutation of Hale's
      political views, reveals the profoundly unconstitutional and tyrannical
      impulses underlying its recommendation. Indeed, the Inquiry Panel
      unabashedly acknowledged that it was recommending Hale's denial to
      practice law <u>not</u> because of any conduct in which he had engaged,
      but rather, because Hale's views were so disagreeable to the two
      individuals who, on that day, happened to comprise a majority of the
      Inquiry Panel.
      <p><b><u>The Hearing Panel's June 30, 1999 rejection of Hale's application</u></b>
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      33.&nbsp;Pursuant to Rule 5.3(a) of the Rules of Procedure, the Inquiry
      Panel's recommendation that Hale not be certified resulted in the
      automatic creation by the Committee of a 5-member &quot;Hearing
      Panel&quot; to determine with finality whether Hale should be certified
      for admission to practice law. Certification by the Hearing Panel would
      presumptively result in Hale's admission. Refusal to certify Hale would
      result in the denial of Hale's admission.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      34.&nbsp;The 5-member Hearing Panel, consisting of the 5 individual
      defendants, convened a hearing on April 10, 1999 in Joliet, Illinois. At
      that hearing, multiple witnesses testified that Hale possessed the
      requisite character and fitness to practice law and that he had always
      displayed a respect even for those laws with which he disagreed.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      35.&nbsp;The evidentiary hearing held by the Hearing Panel had very little
      to do with Hale's conduct or with his fitness to practice law. To the
      contrary, the hearing principally focused on Hale's political and
      religious beliefs. Indeed, the questions asked by the Committee's counsel
      and the Hearing Panel of both Hale and most of his witnesses almost
      exclusively related to the nuances and intricacies of Hale's political and
      religious views.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      36.&nbsp;In sum, the April 10, 1999 hearing that was conducted by the
      Hearing Panel resembled a Spanish Inquisition-like interrogation of a
      person's political thoughts, religious convictions, and core beliefs. The
      vast bulk of the questions were those which would be expected from a
      tribunal charged with policing a person's thoughts and beliefs, not a
      person's conduct, character and fitness to practice law.
      <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
      </SPACER>
      37.&nbsp;Again and again, the Hearing Panel commissioners and the
      Committee's counsel demanded to hear Hale's responses to the political
      arguments they presented against Hale's political and religious beliefs.
      Repeatedly, they questioned Hale and his witnesses as to the underlying

      </SPACER>
      38.&nbsp;At the hearing, defendant Lustfeldt, the Chairman of the Hearing
      Panel, while denying that the inquiry was confined to Hale's beliefs and
      insisting that it instead was focused on his &quot;character,&quot;
      simultaneously acknowledged that the focus of the Hearing Panel's
      assessment of Hale's &quot;character&quot; was the <u>views and beliefs</u>
      he espoused. As defendant Lustfeldt put it:
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>As far as I'm concerned, this is really not about your beliefs <u>except
          as they might be indicative of your character and fitness</u> to be a
          member of the bar . . . . The question is whether you are credible
          when you say [that you can take the attorney oath], and I think the
          difficulty from that is that when <u>someone says every day I believe
          this, I believe this, I believe this and they publicly advocate these
          positions repeatedly and encourage others to take them up and then for
          you to come in here today and say well, I know I say that Jews all
          have to be shipped out of the country and I know I say that blacks are
          like apes, but I'll tell you what, I can do this job, and that's the
          difficulty, you see, in trying to sort this out, and that's been the
          sources of these questions</u>. . . . &nbsp;<br>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>It's not about your beliefs, it's about your character and fitness,
          <u>and one of the windows into somebody's character is what they will
          say</u>, along with what they do, <u>and I think that's the purpose of
          this as far as I'm concerned.</u>&nbsp;<br>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thus, even at the hearing, the Chairman of the Hearing Panel made
      perfectly clear that the reason that so much of the hearing was devoted to
      Hale's political and religious beliefs, rather than his conduct, was
      because -- in the view of the Hearing Panel -- Hale's political and
      religious beliefs were, by themselves, sufficient to question Hale's
      fitness to practice law, as such views provided a &quot;window&quot; into
      his character.

      39.&nbsp;Consistent with defendant Lustfeldt's admissions at the hearing,
      the Hearing Panel decided, on June 30, 1999, to deny Hale's application
      for admission to practice law in Illinois. In a 6-page document, the
      Committee purported to cite 3 reasons for its conclusion:
      <ul>
        <p>(a) &nbsp;that Hale's belief in private-sector racial discrimination,
        and his stated intent to <u>privately</u> discriminate, were
        inconsistent with the &quot;letter and spirt&quot; of the Rules of
        Professional Conduct;
        <ul>
          <p>(b)&nbsp;that Hale's refusal, at the Committee's insistence, to
          &quot;repudiate&quot; a 1995 letter he had written to an advocate of
          affirmative action -- a letter the Committee believed was
          &quot;insulting and totally inappropriate&quot; -- shows a
          &quot;monumental lack of sound judgement&quot; which will put Hale
          &quot;on a collision course with the Rules of Professional
          Conduct&quot;; and,
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <p>(c)&nbsp;in a one-paragraph, indescribably conclusory assertion
          placed at the end of its decision, the Committee claimed that Hale
          &quot;was not open with the panel during the hearing,&quot; but then
          cited two excerpts in the record to demonstrate this was so which
          pertained <u>exclusively</u> to Hale's political views: (i) where Hale
          did nothing more than refuse to assent to the Committee's
          characterization that Hale's statement of his beliefs in the
          above-referenced Affirmative Action letter was
          &quot;inappropriate&quot; and &quot;insulting&quot;; and (ii) where
          Hale did nothing more than refuse to agree with the Committee's
          apparent belief that disseminating literature with swastikas on them
          outside of a prayer breakfast was inappropriately
          &quot;insulting.&quot; In short, the Committee disingenuously, and as
          a pretext, equated Hale's refusal to swear to the Rightness of the
          Committee's views regarding what is and is not &quot;appropriate&quot;
          statement with a lack of &quot;candor&quot; on Hale's part.
        </ul>
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        40.&nbsp;In sum, the Hearing Panel's denial of Hale's application to
        practice law in the State of Illinois was unmistakably, and unabashedly,
        motivated <u>not</u> by any conduct on Hale's part, but rather, by: (a)
        the Committee's disapproval of Hale's political and religious views; (b)
        the Committee's objections to Hale's intent to discriminate on the basis
        of race and religion when forming his private associations; and (c) the
        Committee's &quot;prediction&quot; as to what Hale's future conduct
        likely would be.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        41.&nbsp;In rejecting Hale's application to practice law, the Committee
        violated Hale's most basic and fundamental liberties guaranteed by the
        First and Fourteenth Amendments. Its denial of Hale's application based
        on his political and religious views violated the First Amendment's
        guarantee of free statement. Its punishment of Hale for his private
        associational choices violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free
        association. Its deprivation of Hale's right to practice law based <u>not</u>
        on conduct in which he has actually engaged, but rather, based on
        conduct in which the Committee &quot;predicts&quot; he will engage in
        the future, violates the Fourteenth Amendment's right to due process of
        law.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        42.&nbsp;The grounds invoked by the Hearing Panel to deny Hale's
        application were ones which had not been previously raised by the
        Inquiry Panel. Hale had multiple challenges to the constitutionality of
        the Committee's denial which he wished to raise. In order to have these
        challenges heard and adjudicated, Hale, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule
        708, petitioned the Supreme Court of Illinois for review of the
        Committee's denial. The Illinois Supreme Court, however, refused to hear
        or adjudicate these constitutional challenges.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        43.&nbsp;As a result of the Illinois Supreme Court's refusal to hear or
        adjudicate Hale's constitutional challenges to the Committee's denial,
        the Committee's denial has been unchallenged, and Hale's constitutional
        claims have never been heard or adjudicated.
        <p><b><u>The Rules governing the admissions process</u></b>
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        44.&nbsp;Independent of the Committee's deprivation of Hale's
        Constitutional rights, both the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct,
        as well as the Rules of Procedure for the Board of Admissions and
        Committee on Character and Fitness, are, on their face, unconstitutional
        in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        45.&nbsp;Initially, despite the profound and serious constitutional
        challenges to the acts and decisions of the Committee in rejecting his
        application which Hale wanted to raise, Hale had no opportunity to have
        those constitutional challenges heard or adjudicated. This was so
        because the Rules governing the admissions process guarantee that an
        applicant who is denied admission to practice law in Illinois only has
        the right to appear before the Committee on Character and Fitness, and
        not before a court of general jurisdiction which is bestowed with
        jurisdiction to adjudicate such claims.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        46.&nbsp;Supreme Court Rule 708 provides that an applicant who is denied
        admission to practice law does not have any entitlement to have
        constitutional or other challenges to that denial heard in a court of
        general jurisdiction authorized to adjudicate such claims. Instead, that
        Rule provides that it is in the unfettered discretion of the Illinois
        Supreme Court whether to hear and adjudicate such challenges.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        47.&nbsp;Thus, an applicant can be denied admission to practice law in
        violation of the applicant's constitutional rights, and be consigned to
        the Committee on Character and Fitness, a body with very narrowly
        circumscribed jurisdiction, which is not even authorized to adjudicate
        the applicant's constitutional claims.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        48.&nbsp;Specifically, Rule 4 of the Rules of Procedure of the Board of
        Admissions to the Bar and the Committee on Character and Fitness
        expressly enumerates the narrow issues which the Committee is permitted
        to hear and adjudicate. All such issues are narrow evidentiary issues
        relating to whether the applicant possesses the requisite character and
        fitness to practice law in Illinois. Manifestly, the Committee is a body
        of very limited jurisdiction which does not include jurisdiction to
        adjudicate an applicant's constitutional claims.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        49.&nbsp;Thus, the admissions process, and the specific rules cited, are
        unconstitutional on their face, as they provide for the denial of an
        applicant's right to practice law in Illinois without providing the
        applicant with an opportunity to have constitutional and other
        challenges to that denial heard and adjudicated.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        50.&nbsp;Independently, the Rules are also facially unconstitutional
        because of their substantive provisions. Specifically, Rule 8.4(a)5 of
        the Rules of Professional Conduct prohibits a lawyer from discriminating
        on the basis of race, religion, and national origin not only in the
        lawyer's public and professional life, but also in the lawyer's private
        life. Such a prohibition unduly intrudes into a citizen's free
        associational choices. The First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of
        association prohibits the State from proscribing a citizen's private
        associational choices and from punishing a citizen for the exercise of
        associational choices. As such, Rule 8.4(a)5 of the Rules of
        Professional Conduct, on its face, is unconstitutional in violation of
        this First Amendment right.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        51.&nbsp;Similarly, Rule 8.4(a)5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct
        prohibits a lawyer from advocating precepts of discrimination on the
        basis of race, religion, and national origin. Such a prohibition unduly
        intrudes into a citizen's right of free statement. The First Amendment's
        guarantee of freedom of statement prohibits the State from proscribing
        the views which a citizen is permitted to express and from punishing a
        citizen for the exercise of free statement. As such, Rule 8.4(a)5 of the
        Rules of Professional Conduct, on its face, is unconstitutional in
        violation of this First Amendment right.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        52.&nbsp;Thus, not only did the Committee violate Hale's fundamental
        constitutional rights, and not only are the Rules governing admissions
        unconstitutional on their face, but also, the procedural rules governing
        the admissions process provided Hale with no opportunity to be heard
        with regard to these constitutional challenges to the denial of his
        right to a livelihood and to practice law.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        53.&nbsp;As a result of these patent, reckless and wanton violations of
        his constitutional rights by defendants, Hale, for almost two years, has
        been denied the right to practice law in Illinois and has therefore been
        severely injured. Moreover, the facially unconstitutional rules and laws
        governing the admission process, unless enjoined, are certain to be
        applied to future applicants, including Hale, in order to deny those
        applicants fundamental constitutional rights.

        misconduct in which plaintiff actually engaged, but instead, based on
        the Committee's prediction that he will, in the future, engage in
        conduct violative of the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct.

        enforced, encouraged and sanctioned Rule 8.4(a)5 of the Illinois Rules
        of Professional Conduct, a statute which is unconstitutional on its

        any person on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin,
        regardless of whether such discrimination is committed in the attorneys'
        professional or private life. Thus, this Rule allows that a bar

        96.&nbsp;The Supreme Court of Illinois drafted, codified, implemented,
        enforced, encouraged and sanctioned the Illinois Supreme Court Rule 708
        and Rule 4 of the Rules of Procedure for Character and Fitness
        Committees. These Rules, taken together, allow the Committee on
        Character and Fitness and Board of Admissions to deprive bar applicants
        of rights, privileges and property while denying those applicants an
        opportunity to be heard with respect to their claim that such
        deprivation constitutes a violation of their constitutional rights.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        97.&nbsp;Illinois Supreme Court Rule 708 provides that an applicant who
        is denied admission by the Committee on Character and Fitness does not
        have a right to have constitutional claims, or any other claims,
        regarding that denial heard in any court of general jurisdiction, such
        as the Supreme Court. Instead, Rule 708(d) provides that such an
        application has the right only &quot;to petition the Supreme Court for
        review,&quot; a petition which the Supreme Court may, in its unfettered
        discretion, grant or deny.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        98.&nbsp;Thus, an applicant can be denied admission to practice law in
        violation of the applicant's constitutional rights, and be consigned to
        being heard not in a court of general jurisdiction, but instead, only in
        the Committee on Character and Fitness, a body with very narrowly
        circumscribed jurisdiction, which is not even authorized to adjudicate
        the applicant's constitutional claims.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        99.&nbsp;Specifically, Rule 4 of the Rules of Procedure of the Board of
        Admissions to the Bar and the Committee on Character and Fitness
        expressly enumerates the narrow issues which the Committee is permitted
        to hear and adjudicate. All such issues are narrow evidentiary issues
        relating to whether the applicant possesses the requisite character and
        fitness to practice law in Illinois. Manifestly, the Committee is a body
        of very limited jurisdiction which does not include jurisdiction to
        adjudicate an applicant's constitutional claims.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        100.&nbsp;Thus, Illinois Supreme Court Rule 708 and Rule 4 of the Rules
        of Procedure establishes a system whereby an applicant can be denied
        rights, privileges and property without ever having an opportunity to be
        heard with regard to claims concerning the unconstitutionality of said
        denial, and without ever having the applicants' arguments heard in, or
        adjudicated by, a court of general jurisdiction.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">
        </SPACER>
        101.&nbsp;The deprivation of rights, privileges and property without a
        full opportunity to be heard violates the Fourteenth Amendment right to
        due process of law. Such deprivation contravenes clear, well-established
        principles of which reasonable persons would be aware.
        <p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="72">

        103.&nbsp;Future application of these facially unconstitutional rules in
