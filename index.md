# Intro

_This site is incomplete and under active development in June 2021_. 
For those in search of further details and evidence, here are some starting points wtih [threads about Glenn on Twitter](TwitterThreads.md){: .btn .btn--success}. 


## Other Sites About Glenn

![Boys From Brazil](assets/images/boysbrazil.jpg){: .align-left .jason} Glenn has inspired a remarkable number of web pages - even entire sites - specifically about him. Few are praiseworthy. Some of the earliest were about Glenn's famous sock-puppets, in 2006. Others cover material from Edward Snowden, to porn production, to his whole history of lies.  
_UPDATED_{: .new} See our collection of [pages by Glenn's Antifans.](SitesAboutGlenn.md){: .btn .btn--danger}
{: .notice--success} 


<br>{: .cl}

# Glenn's Blue Period

Glenn has stated in [profiles and interviews](/interviews) <span>New</span>{: .new }  
that his involvement in the porn industry ended in 2004, 2-3 years after it started.

That would make it exactly 100 years after Picasso's Blue Period,  
although Picasso did not claim it was merely incidental to his legal work.  
{: .notice--info}

_But is Glenn's claim true?_  
The New York Daily News, Buzzfeed, The Guardian and others seemed too shy to check.

## The Canadian Government Position 

Paul Calandra, likely informed by Canadian Intelligence, described him as a **Porn Spy**.
<div class="vide">
{% include video id="CUOXOc68nKY" provider="youtube" %}
</div>
Previously he was described as a
[former porn industry executive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNQ_aVaMMw4&t=23s){: .btn .btn--warning}

## Nearly Eight Years
> One person we can check with is Jake Jaxson, his former business partner.
> He doesn't say anything about two years.
> And the documents support Jason.
<div class="vide">
{% include video id="f_BskTnqY8U?start=46" provider="youtube" %}
</div>

### Jason Sketchy pages
Jake Jaxson's real name is Jason Buchtel, 
but we just call him [Jason Sketchy](Jason.md).


## Glenn's forgotten websites

We host our own reconstructions of some of Glenn's lost websites. I don't expect he will be grateful for their rediscovery.

These are constructed almost entirely based on material from the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org) but with faster and more reliable navigation, and fewer dead links.



### RioGayGuides and RioMaleEscorts 
_A reconstruction of sites Glenn and David set up in Brazil in 2005_.

### HX articles: Glenn's porn tips
![Cheap Trixx](hxn/web.archive.org/web/20050221102140im_/http:/www.hx.com/images/hxlogo.gif) was the leading gay listings magazine in New York City for most of the 90s and 00s.

In February 2005, the very same week that Glenn and David "met on the beach" in Rio, back in NYC, HX published an article under the by-line of an unknown writer and "resting" lawyer, Glenn Greenwald.  
How did you ever manage without its handy advice?
{: .notice--info}



> DON'T forget about the sound. If you're shooting in New York, close your windows!  
> Nothing is worse than the sound of hot sex being drowned out by sirens, passing buses and couples fighting next door.

Now _UPDATED_{: .new}  to include [Razor Burned.](Sullivan.md){: .btn .btn--danger .btn--large}  
How did Glenn get Andrew Sullivan, who was much more famous than Glenn at the time, to write this promotional piece for his porn company?

### David Miranda - Director and Custodian of Records
*R or X-rated links*{: .notice--warning}

David Miranda's porn direction career really took off at exactly the same time as Glenn moved to Brazil.



[One major porn catalog lists him as director for eight movies](https://gay.aebn.com/gay/directors/19979/david-miranda)

The [Gay Erotic Video Index Studmall listing](https://www.gayeroticvideoindex.com/C/7/6277.html) has some interesting surprises.  
Especially the box covers.



> This can get a little complicated. Branding is not consistent, catalogs are not perfectly accurate, and
> [![Tattooed Tops](assets/images/1528420bh-custodian.jpg){: .align-right}](assets/images/1528420bh.jpg)
> multiple box covers can exist for the same movie. Here's a genuine box cover for Tattooed Tops
> although you won't find it in the list I just mentioned. **David Miranda, 2010**.

### What's Glenn's Best Movie?

We're not really a movie review site.  
More of a _This Movie Really Exists and Glenn Really Produced It?_ site.

But since you asked, we're currently fond of this.

## BetterCallGlenn

A number of allegations appeared on the Brazilian site BetterCallGlenn.com in 2019.
The site is no longer active but most of the articles are preserved on the Internet Archive.  
Although we have been unable to confirm key parts of these,
they contain many details which we have verified and were not at all widely known.

# Other Lies


## Glenn's earliest ventures

The Sun Sentinel in 1985 [reported](SunSentinel.md) on Glenn's attempts to win his grandfather's old council seat.  
That's the _self-taught, deprived childhood_ myth, shattered.


## Legal Career: Matthew Hale

Glenn condemned the denial of law license to a leading American Neo-Nazi as 
an "egregious constiutional abuse" in [this court filing.](/cases/HaleEgregious.md)


More recent lies cover all conceivable subjects. But one deserves singling out.

# Keira Knightley Guest Appearance

The only specific link this has with Glenn is that it's very creepy. 
But we need somewhere to put a video that Google appear to be trying very hard to hide.
