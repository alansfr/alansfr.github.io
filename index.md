# Highlights

_This site is still very much under development. The best of the site so far is in this section_.  

## Glenn's Blue Period

Glenn has stated many times that his involvement in the porn industry was incidental to his legal work and ended in 2004, exactly 100 years after Picasso's Blue Period ended and also lasting just 2-3 years.  
_Can this be true?_

### The Canadian Government Position
Paul Calandra, likely informed by Canadian Intelligence, described him as a  
**former porn industry executive**.
<div class="vide">
{% include video id="oFLo0k4VzyQ" provider="youtube" %}
</div>

### Nearly Eight Years
> One person we can check with is Jake Jaxson, his former business partner.
> He doesn't say anything about two years.
> And the documents support Jason.
{% include video id="f_BskTnqY8U?start=46" provider="youtube" %}

#### Jason Sketchy pages
_NEW_{: .notice .new} 
Jake Jaxson's real name is Jason Buchtel, 
but we just call him [Jason Sketchy](Jason.md){: .btn .btn--danger .btn--large}



## Glenn's forgotten websites

We host our own reconstructions of some of Glenn's lost websites. I don't expect he will be grateful for their rediscovery.

These are constructed almost entirely based on material from the [Wayback Machine](archive.org) but with faster and more reliable navigation, and fewer dead links.



### RioGayGuides and RioMaleEscorts 
_A reconstruction of sites Glenn and David set up in Brazil in 2005_.


{% include feature_row %}


### HX articles: Glenn's porn tips
![Cheap Trixx](hxn/web.archive.org/web/20050221102140im_/http:/www.hx.com/images/hxlogo.gif) was the leading gay listings magazine in New York City for most of the 90s and 00s.

In February 2005, the very same week that Glenn and David "met on the beach" in Rio; back in NYC, HX published an article by an unknown writer and "resting" lawyer, Glenn Greenwald.  

How did you ever manage without its handy advice?

*DON'T forget about the sound. If you're shooting in New York, close your windows! Nothing is worse than the sound of hot sex being drowned out by sirens, passing buses and couples fighting next door.*

## Published Articles about Greenwald's porn empire

New York Daily News article: [Glenn Greenwald was once lawyer sued over porn business](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/greenwald-reporter-broke-nsa-story-lawyer-sued-porn-biz-article-1.1383448)

{% include feature_row id="feature_row2" type="left" %}


### David Miranda - Director and Custodian of Records
*R or X-rated links*{: .notice--warning}

David Miranda's porn direction career really took off at exactly the same time as Glenn moved to Brazil.



[One major porn catalog lists him as director for eight movies](https://gay.aebn.com/gay/directors/19979/david-miranda)

The [Gay Erotic Video Index Studmall listing](https://www.gayeroticvideoindex.com/C/7/6277.html) has some interesting surprises.  
Especially the box covers.



> This can get a little complicated. Branding is not consistent, catalogs are not perfectly accurate, and
> [![Tattooed Tops](assets/images/1528420bh-custodian.jpg){: .align-right}](assets/images/1528420bh.jpg)
> multiple box covers can exist for the same movie. Here's a genuine box cover for Tattooed Tops
> although you won't find it in the list I just mentioned. **David Miranda, 2010**.

### What's Glenn's Best Movie?

We're not really a movie review site.  
More of a _This Movie Really Exists and Glenn Really Produced It?_ site.

_New_{: .notice--danger .new}  But since you asked, we're currently fond of this.

## Other Lies

There cover all conceivable subjects. Some are mentioned in
[Twitter Threads *about* Glenn](TwitterThreads.md){: .btn .btn--success} 

But one deserves singling out.
[Does Glenn have a Pulitzer?](pulitzer.md){: .btn .btn--warning .btn--large} 

## BetterCallGlenn

A number of allegations appeared on the Brazilian site BetterCallGlenn.com in 2019.
The site is no longer active but most of the articles are preserved on the Internet Archive.  
Although we have been unable to confirm key parts of these,
they contain many details which we have verified and were not at all widely known.

# Keira Knightley Guest Appearance

This only specific link this has with Glenn is that it's very creepy. 
But we need somewhere to put a video Google appear to be trying very hard to hide.
