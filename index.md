We are here to chronicle the life of our antihero, Glenn Greenwald, especially the parts he either avoids talking about, or disguises with elaborate lies.


# Glenn's Pornography and Prostitution Businsesses 

## Glenn's own forgotten websites, articles and forum posts

To start, take a look at [His Name is Rio](hxRio.md){: .btn .btn--success} - written under Glenn's own byline in 2006.  It was one of the hardest things to find on the Internet Archive, and by the time we did so we already knew that the owner and operator of the agencies it describes, named Curtis Jacobs in that article, was really Glenn.




There are plenty of reasons we know that Rio Gay Guides and Rio Male Escorts were founded by Glenn and his NYC-based business partner, Jake Jaxson. For example a prototype version of the site existed some months earlier within Hairy Studs Video, whose ownership was [documented in 2013  by NY Daily News] (#first-us-published-articles-about-greenwalds-porn-empire), although largely forgotten.

We host our own reconstructions of some of Glenn's lost websites, almost entirely based on material from the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org) but with faster and more reliable navigation, and fewer dead links.

The sites themselves describe the owners, and David Miranda's email address and photo appeared prominently on the sites as a kind of front-of-house manager. 


### RioGayGuides and RioMaleEscorts 
_A reconstruction of sites Glenn and David set up in Brazil in 2005_.


{% include feature_row %}



<br>{: .cl}


Before delving further into Glenn's involvement with Studmall, and the manifest lie that he was the legal coffee boy who left the porn business behind in 2004 before leaving for Brazil, we note one detail that leads to a whole lot more.





### DomMascHry31 aka HairyDomBraz27 aka Doug69 **UPDATED**{: .vnew} 

<div markdown="1">
Glenn's email address is quoted by _NY Daily News_ (from court depositions) as **DomMascHry31@aol.com**. This can also be found in the [domain records of Studmall](/DNS/#complete-reports-for-studmall-hairystudsvideo-and-bareback-inc) alongside the mailing address for Glenn's old law firm.  
[![DomEscort31NYC](assets/images/HerrDom.png){: .align-right .modcard}](/assets/images/HerrDom.png)
There's one other place we have found this email address. It belongs to an account called [DomEscort31NYC](https://www.companyofmen.org/topic/3656-hairy-athlete-types/#comment-35977) who [invites](https://www.companyofmen.org/topic/3656-hairy-athlete-types/?do=findComment&comment=35979) interested users to email him. The offer is pretty extreme even for the male4male escort review chat site, where it was posted.  
With a bit more work, other accounts of Glenn's can be found on that site, including HairyDomBraz27 and his political alt from 2003-5, Doug69.

Highlights include:
- [The visa I've obtained is an Investor's visa](https://www.companyofmen.org/topic/27614-serious-immigration-danger/#comment-258675) is one of several threads in which Glenn describes his moving to Rio in 2005.
- [Here's an interesting article](https://www.companyofmen.org/topic/8309-recommendations-for-a-good-site-for-mail-order-porn-dvds/#comment-87107) Although the link is dead, it is not hard to verify from the id parameter that this was a shameless plug for [this article by Glenn](hx.md)
- [Looking for a lawyer in Rio](https://www.companyofmen.org/topic/27565-looking-for-a-lawyer-in-rio/#comment-258560) in which Glenn forgets he is supposed to be using an Alt.
- [Iraq Sheltered Terrorists](https://www.companyofmen.org/topic/29712-iraq-sheltered-terrorists/), writes a shocked Glenn in April 2003 when he was a cheerleader for the Iraq War.  

**NEW**{: .vnew .align-left} The search facility on the forum seems to currently be broken so we have included a list of links to all 527 topics with a contribution from Doug69 [here](/Doug69Links.html){: .btn  .btn--large .btn--danger}.

## First US-Published Articles about Greenwald's porn empire

In 2013 _NY Daily News_ uncovered an acrimonious court case from 2002-4.
We believe it is likely this was the result of a tip-off by one of Glenn's former associates.

The court documents showed that Master Notions, which operated the porn brands HairyStudsVideo and Studmall, was co-owned and operated by Glenn Greenwald and Jason Buchtel.  

_One of the very few published updates to this story, which appeared in Washington Babylon in 2021,   we've put here too._{: .notice--info}

{% include feature_row id="feature_row2" %}
[Alternative Link to NY Daily News article](https://www.pressreader.com/usa/new-york-daily-news/20130627/281616712946068)








It appears Glenn tried to get ahead of the _NY Daily News_ revelations by publishing his account,
which he has repeated with multiple variations in profiles and interviews since. See [Key Excerpts and links](/interviews/){: .btn .btn--danger} for some of these.


<div markdown="1">
He admitted to co-ownwership of Hairy Studs Video and Studmall
**but stated that his involvement in the porn industry ended in 2004, 2-3 years after it started**  .

**But is Glenn's claim true?**

If it is, then Glenn's Blue Period would be exactly 100 years after Picasso's.  
Had _New York Daily News_, _Buzzfeed_, _The Guardian_ and others not been too shy to check, they might have quickly realized there is overwhelming evidence against Glenn's version of events.

### David Miranda - Director and Custodian of Records
*R or X-rated links*{: .notice--warning}

![Piss Boys In Love GayEroticVideoIndex listing](/assets/images/PissBoysInLove.jpg){: .align-right .modcard}
David Miranda's porn director career took off at exactly the same time as Glenn moved to Brazil.  
[One major porn catalog lists David Miranda as director for eight movies](https://gay.aebn.com/gay/directors/19979/david-miranda)  
and the [Gay Erotic Video Index Studmall listing](https://www.gayeroticvideoindex.com/C/7/6277.html) has some interesting surprises some of which also appear  in our [Gallery of Box Covers](/boxcovers/).

## Brazilian Reporting

[![David](/assets/images/DMstand.jpg){: .align-right .jason}](/assets/images/DMstand.jpg)
Articles in the Brazilian press in August 2019, first alleged that said Glenn had produced porn in Brazil, with David, and for a considerable while.  
They were based on interviews and did not seem to have any actual post-2004 records or movie titles. We do not know with whom and we cannot verify all the details.
Yet some of the facts they stated about dates, locations  and people involved --- not previously published --- we can verify by other means. None of these articles is a hit piece that someone casually made up.  
David's role as talent scout for movies Glenn produced was described in 
[Era Garoto de Programa](/DavidTalentScout.html)
{: .notice--danger}



### BetterCallGlenn

A Brazilian site devoted to this subject, BetterCallGlenn.com, was created in 2019.
The site is no longer active but most of the articles are preserved on the Internet Archive.  

We have included a number of translations as well as links to the originals, which can be accessed from the sidebar those pages.  
Start with [A sexual predator named Glenn Greenwald, Part 1](predator-part-1.md)



## More of Glenn's HX articles: Glenn's porn tips


![HX](hxn/web.archive.org/web/20050221102140im_/http:/www.hx.com/images/hxlogo.gif) was the leading gay listings magazine in New York City for most of the 90s and 00s.
{: .notice--success}

In February 2005, the very same week that Glenn and David "met on the beach" in Rio, back in NYC, HX published an article **Cheap Trixxx** under the by-line of an unknown writer and "resting" lawyer, Glenn Greenwald.  
How did you ever manage without its handy advice?
> DON'T forget about the sound. If you're shooting in New York, close your windows!  
> Nothing is worse than the sound of hot sex being drowned out by sirens, passing buses and couples fighting next door.


The article was simultaneously promoted on the Studmall.com website.
[Read it here.](/hxpromo/){: .btn .btn--large .btn--danger}


A couple of years earlier, HX published [Razor Burned.](Sullivan.md){: .btn .btn--primary}  promoting Hairy Studs Video, by Andrew Sullivan.  
How did Glenn get Andrew Sullivan, who was much more famous than Glenn at the time, to write this promotional piece for his porn company?
{: .notice--success}



## The Canadian Government Position 

Paul Calandra, likely informed by Canadian Intelligence, described him as a **Porn Spy**.
<div class="vide">
{% include video id="CUOXOc68nKY" provider="youtube" %}
</div>
Previously he had described Glenn as a
[former porn industry executive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNQ_aVaMMw4&t=23s){: .btn .btn--warning}  
These statements, made in late 2013, suggested a much greater involvement in the industry than Glenn had admitted to New York Daily News. But they did not give details.

## Jason Sketchy

### "Nearly Eight Years"

<div markdown="1">
> One person we can check with is Jake Jaxson, his former business partner.
> He doesn't say anything about two years.
> And the documents support Jason.
<div class="vide">
{% include video id="f_BskTnqY8U?start=46" provider="youtube" %}
</div>
</div>

### Jason Sketchy pages
Jake Jaxson's real name is Jason Buchtel, 
but we just call him [Jason Sketchy](Jason.md).



### What's Glenn's Best Movie?

We're not really a movie review site.  
More of a _This Movie Really Exists and Glenn Really Produced It?_ site.

But since you asked, we're currently fond of this.

# Other Sites About Glenn


>![Boys From Brazil](assets/images/boysbrazil.jpg){: .align-right .jason} Glenn has inspired a remarkable number of web pages - even entire sites - specifically about him.  Some of the earliest were [about Glenn's famous sock-puppets](https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/glenn_greenwalds_ip_address_stolen/), in 2006. Others cover material from Edward Snowden, to porn production, to his whole history of lies.   
Few are praiseworthy and quite have an expressly stated goal of warning abouut Glenn, such as [this from 2013](https://joshuafoust.com/pathetic-slap-from-lying-bully/):
> > It is inexplicable that so few have ever called him out by name for such deplorable, unethical behavior.
> > So I am doing it as plainly as I possibly can. Glenn Greenwald is a serial liar.
> > He is a bully. And he has no business being taken seriously ever again.  
> 
> We have collected many of these antif-fan pages [here.](SitesAboutGlenn.md){: .btn .btn--danger}

# Other Lies



## Legal Career: Matthew Hale

Glenn condemned the denial of law license to a leading American Neo-Nazi as 
an "egregious constiutional abuse" in [this court filing.](/cases/HaleEgregious.md). Although he claims now to have been a "First Amendment" lawyer, his failed attempt to claim a constitutional right to a law license may have been his only such case.

We have collected some details of his cases, including two [representing HX Magazine.](/cases/Theissen.html){: .btn .btn--info}
{: .notice--primary}

## Awards

The subject Glenn lies about the most is himself.
In his telling, he [graduated top of his class](/Lies.html) and even
thinks he has a [Pulitzer Prize](pulitzer.md){: .btn .btn--warning .btn--large}

## Glenn's earliest ventures

The Sun Sentinel in 1985 [reported](SunSentinel.md) on Glenn's attempts to win his grandfather's old council seat.  
That's the _self-taught, deprived childhood_ myth, shattered.
Other links to news articles from Glenn's early life are also here.

On September 20, 2022, Glenn's announced that David's candidacy for re-election has been withdrawn.  
David allegedly remains in ICU, where he has been for the past six weeks,  
although the only source for thie is Glenn.
