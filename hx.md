This may be the first article ever published by Glenn Greenwald under his own name.  
This is as it appears on the HX website but most readers will have read the print version, a copy of which was posted on Glenn's Studmall website (see sidebar).  
HX magazine was also a [legal client](/cases/Theissen.html) of Glenn's on multiple occasions.
