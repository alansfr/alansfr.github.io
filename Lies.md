# Glenn at NYU

A 2013 [interview in the Advocate](https://www.advocate.com/print-issue/current-issue/2013/11/12/enemy-state) is one superlative after another, amongst which:
> Grappling with the powerful head-on was more attractive to Greenwald than actual politicking or policymaking, so he went off to law school at NYU, graduated top of his class, and went to work for one of the most slickly prestigious law firms in New York: Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. 

It goes onto explain how this superstar lawyer sued Rollerblade (and lost) because he had a boyfriend who couldn't skate But let's back up a little:

_graduated top of his class_ --- that's quite a bold claim.

In [Scalon v. Kessler](https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/23/413/), a federal district court ruling by Judge Motley about Glenn's exorbitant fees, footnote 2 states:
> In 1994, Greenwald graduated **cum laude** from New York University School of Law and was a member of its law review for two years. Prior to forming his own firm, Greenwald spent one year as a junior associate at Watchell, Lipton, Rosen, and Katz, a major New York law firm.

Top of his class is normally _summa cum laude_. In fact, the NYU Law School [guidance on grades](http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/gradesAcademicStandards.pdf) makes is clear top could also be _magna cum laude_. 

> ### Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude and Summa Cum Laude  
> The following honors are awarded each year to members of the graduating class: Cum laude: to graduates whose grade point average places them in the top 25% of their class. Magna cum laude: to graduates whose grade point average places them in the top 10% of their class. Summa cum laude: to the very few students (if any in a particular year) who, in the judgment of the Executive Committee, have compiled a truly outstanding academic record.

It cannot, however, be merely _cum laude_.

## Rudy Did Better

  Sorry, Glenn, you're lying again.  
Try a bit harder next time and you could be as good as Rudy.
