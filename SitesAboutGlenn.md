Many others have devoted webpages, or in some cases entire sites, to pointing out Glenn's faults: his anti-fans.  In fact the only people with more devoted anti-fans than Glenn are, or have at some point been, autocratic dictators of fair-sized nations.  
Here we catalog some of those pages and similar material, loosely arranged by subject matter.

- ``January 2020`` This repeats a lot of lies from Glenn's 2013 Buzzfeed Interview. But it has much better photos.

Apparently based in part on an interview with someone now in Argentina, we cannot verify all the details. But like the [Better Call Glenn pages](/predator-part-2.md), key details do fit documentary evidence.  
Amongst other allegations, it says:  
> Dressed as Darth Vader, Glenn Greenwald performed his sexual fantasies with young men without much hair on their bodies, who were called by the American “My Anaquim”.

# Glenn in the replies

A number of web pages are something of the opposite: not about Glenn at all, but noteworthy for the references to Glenn in the replies.

``July 23, 2020`` Replying to Ezra Klein: _Wow, there are more sockpuppets here than a Glenn Greenwald slumber party._ [When Tucker Carlson asked to join Journolist](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/07/when_tucker_carlson_asked_to_j.html)
