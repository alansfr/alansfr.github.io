# The Anti-Fandom of Glenn Greenwald.

Glenn has an extraordinarily devoted antifan following.  

As far back as 2006, they were creating pages and entire sites to catelog his lies.


## All Things Glenn

- ``Jan 31, 2016`` Dave Emory on Spitfire List: [Compendium on Citizen Greenwald: A Shiller for Killers](http://spitfirelist.com/for-the-record/ftr-888-compendium-on-citizen-greenwald-a-shiller-for-killers/)

## Porn and Master Notions

Apparently based in part on an interview with someone now in Argentina, we cannot verify all the details. But like the Better Call Glenn pages, key details do fit documentary evidence.  
Amongst other allegations, it says:  
> Dressed as Darth Vader, Glenn Greenwald performed his sexual fantasies with young men without much hair on their bodies, who were called by the American “My Anaquim”.

The highlight of [this July 2006 version](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glenn_Greenwald&oldid=66453842){: .btn .btn--info} is a definition:
> __glenn of sock puppets__: multiple sock-puppets driving home exactly the same points, usually
> starting with a recitation of the puppet-master’s resume.

# Glenn in the replies

A number of web pages are something of the opposite: not about Glenn at all, but noteworthy for the references to Glenn in the replies.

``July 23, 2020`` Replying to Ezra Klein: _Wow, there are more sockpuppets here than a Glenn Greenwald slumber party._ [When Tucker Carlson asked to join Journolist](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/07/when_tucker_carlson_asked_to_j.html)
