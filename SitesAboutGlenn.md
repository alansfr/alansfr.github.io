# The Anti-Fandom of Glenn Greenwald.

Glenn has an extraordinarily devoted antifan following.

As far back as 2006, they were creating pages and entire sites to catelog his lies.

> __glenn of sock puppets__: multiple sock-puppets driving home exactly the same points, usually
> starting with a recitation of the puppet-master’s resume.
