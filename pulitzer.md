# Well, does he?

Of course not. 

Awkward [the Pulitzer people even had to address the question](https://blog.erratasec.com/2014/04/no-glenn-greenwald-did-not-win-pulitzer.html#.YLhmeS1Q3UJ). 

## That Pulitzer Email

Detailed explanation to come, but this is the definitive email.

## The Pulitzer website

### Where's Glenndo?

This appears on the [Pulitzer website](https://www.pulitzer.org/event/2014-pulitzer-prize-luncheon), with that caption. There are other photographs of the awwards ceremony at the bottom of that page including the Guardian awards winners.

Do you really think Glenn would have skipped the awards ceremony if he'd been invited, when he bothered to fly from Brazil to the US for the awards _annoucement_ and the Polk a month earlier?

## What did Glenn pick up?



Glenn flew back to NYC barely in time to collect a Polk award and in anticipation of the Pulizer Prize annoucement.  
During a very busy day, he found time to tweet excitedly about the release from prison of the neo-Nazi, Weev.

> ### _"What's up bro?"_

Depending on whether you believe what was said at the time, or what Glenn said years later, he either:

- spent the weekend partying with known Nazi Weev;
- or was photobombed by unknown future Nazi Weev.

_More details in the linked Twitter threads_.
