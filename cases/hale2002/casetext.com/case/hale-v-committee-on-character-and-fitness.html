                                <p class="paragraph" pa-id="9" id="pa9"> Hale, a well-known advocate of racism and
                                    anti-semitism, graduated from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale School of
                                    Law in 1998 with a J.D. degree. Subsequently, Hale completed and passed the Illinois
                                    State Bar Examination. In the summer of 1998, Hale applied for admission into the
                                    Illinois State Bar. Hale did not conceal or dilute his racial and anti-semitic views
                                    in his application. Hale did affirm that he had the ability and intended to comply
                                    with all of the rules and laws governing the conduct of an attorney, regardless of
                                    whether he agreed or disagreed with such rules and laws. </p>

                                    the State of Illinois ("the Rules of Procedure"), Hale's application was referred to
                                    a single member of the Third District Committee for consideration. This member
                                    advised the Board that he was not prepared to recommend that Hale be admitted to
                                    practice law in Illinois. </p>
                                <p class="paragraph" pa-id="11" id="pa11"> Pursuant to Rule 5.2(a) of the Rules of
                                    Procedure, the Chairperson of the Third District Committee assigned Hale's
                                    application to a three-person "Inquiry Panel" for further review, examination, and
                                    recommendation as to whether Hale was or was not fit to practice law. On December
                                    18, 1998, in a 2-1 written decision, the Inquiry Panel recommended that the
                                    Committee withhold Hale's admission to practice law in Illinois. The Committee
                                    stated that "the reasons for [its] decision relates to the applicant's active
                                    advocacy of core beliefs." </p>
                                <p class="paragraph" pa-id="12" id="pa12"> The Inquiry Panel's recommendation that Hale
                                    not be certified resulted in the automatic creation by the Committee of a
                                    five-member "Hearing Panel" to determine with finality whether Hale should be
                                    certified for admission to practice law. A hearing was held on April 10, 1999. At
                                    the hearing, multiple witnesses testified that Hale possessed the requisite
                                    character and fitness to practice law and that he had always displayed a respect for
                                    the law, even those with which he disagreed with. The questions asked by the Hearing
                                    Panel and the Committee's counsel almost exclusively related to the nuances and
                                    intricacies of Hale's political and religious views. On June 30, 1999, the Inquiry
                                    Panel denied Hale's application. Cited reasons for denying Hale's application
                                    included: (1) Hale's belief in private-sector racial discrimination and his intent
                                    to privately discriminate were inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Rules
                                    of Professional Conduct; (2) Hale's refusal to repudiate a 1995 letter that the
                                    Committee believed was insulting and inappropriate showed a "monumental lack of
                                    sound judgment" that would put Hale "on a collision course with the Rules of
                                    Professional Conduct; and (3) the Committee's conclusion that Hale "was not open
                                    with the panel during the hearing". </p>
                                <p class="paragraph" pa-id="13" id="pa13"> The grounds invoked by the hearing Panel to
                                    deny Hale's application were ones which had not previously been raised by the
                                    Inquiry Panel. Hale had multiple challenges to the constitutionality of the
                                    Committee's denial which he wished to raise. </p>
                                <p class="paragraph" pa-id="14" id="pa14"> Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 708, Hale
                                    petitioned the Supreme Court of Illinois for review of the Committee's denial. Hale
                                    asked the Illinois Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of the Committee's
                                    decision. In the petition to the Supreme Court, Hale argued that he "must be
                                    admitted to the Illinois Bar". The Committee filed a response in opposition to
                                    Hale's petition for review. The Committee sought that the Illinois Supreme Court
                                    sustain the decision of the hearing panel and deny certification of Hale's bar
                                    application. On November 12, 1999, the Illinois Supreme Court denied Hale's
                                    petition. </p>
                                <p class="paragraph" pa-id="15" id="pa15"> Subsequently, Hale petitioned the United

                                    the Supreme Court's denial of Hale's petition for review constitutes a final
                                    decision of Hale's claims on the merits. Accordingly, Hale's claims are barred by
                                    the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>. </p>
                                <p class="paragraph" pa-id="32" id="pa32"> In light of the above findings, this Court
                                    need not address Defendants' claim that Hale's First Amended Complaint fails to
                                    state a claim. </p>
                                <p class="paragraph" pa-id="33" id="pa33"> For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion
                                    to Dismiss is granted. Hale's First Amended Complaint is dismissed with prejudice.
                                </p>
