## List of Links


This page is primarily a list of links into the male4malescort discussion forums (currently branded companyofmen.org) where Glenn posted extensively from 2002 to 2005. Included because the search facility on the forum is recently broken. 
[![DougMising](assets/images/DougMissing.png){: .align-right .jason}](assets/images/DougMissing.png)  
Some of the threads where Glenn aka Doug69 makes especially interesting contributions are highlighted in the list in green.   
We have added some links for Glenn's earlier profiles: 
- DomEscort31NYC whose email address led us to this forum, and
- HairyDomBraz27 who was even publicly identified on the site as being the same person as Doug69, marketed himself as a Brazilian from HairyStudsVideo who didn't speak English, and went off on extended rants sounding exactly like Glenn.


<div markdown="1">
### Locally hosted threads.
As of February 14, 2023, the political topics have been deleted on the forum. This impacts around 20-25% of the links below, the threads where Glenn made a contribution.  
A few of these deleted pages exist on the Wayback Machine and we have changed a number of links accordingly. Most are not.  
Fortunately, we have copies. Some work was needed to make them available here (considerable de-duplication, and some removal of dependencies on dead external resources).  
**UPDATED**{: .vnew} We are now making steady progress with including all the deleted material on this site. Those we have added already have had the links adjusted and are marked _locally hosted_ below.
- Note that many of the links within the locally hosted pages are broken but most of them are unnecessary.
- The critical links that should work are to other pages in the same thread, except in cases where the pages are missing.
- None of the pages with a contribution from Glenn in the form of Doug69 is missing.  
The real reason for this deletion is unclear, but combined with a number of other changes, the timing is extremely suspicious.

### DomEscort31NYC Links

- [Hairy Athlete Types](https://www.companyofmen.org/topic/3656-hairy-athlete-types/)
