      The closely linked sites RioGayGuides.com and RioMaleEscorts.com existed between 2005 and 2007 and substantial parts were preserved by the Internet Archive.  
      Glenn's husband is pictured front and center, and the email contact listed on the site uses his name.
      > The **Take a Look** button leads to material elsewhere on this site, in this case reconstructed from the Internet Archive which is often slow, and whose links and images can behave erractically depending on the snapshot date. Links to key IA pages are provided alongside the reconstruction.

      Glenn, then unknown, wrote an article _under his own name_ in NYC's leading gay nightlife and listings magazine which promoted these businesses in early 2006 using unusual language celebrating exploitation. His husband, who spoke very little English, was nominally a co-author and a mysterious "Curtis Jacobs" (never mentioned before nor since) is said to owner.

      The business was also promoted through an escort review site, male4malescorts.com, with a comical mix of poor reviews and wildly enthusiastic fake reviews. One of the promotional reviews in late 2005 listed the email address of the agency as GlennG@RioMaleEscorts.com.

      Early versions of the RioGayGuides pages turn out to have been available on the HairyStudsVideo.com site. Their text closely matches parts of the [RioGayGuides](/RioG.html) site.
      The "about" page perfectly describes Glenn (who moved to Rio) and [Jason](/Jason.html) who remained based in NYC and subsequently became owner and CEO of CockyBoys.com, the second most significant gay porn company in New York.  
      > HairyStudsVideo is known to have been owned by Glenn and Jason. Glenn admitted this to _NY Daily News_ and in other interviews as discussed on the [home page](/index.html). This is also clear from the [DNS Records](/DNS) and the fact Glenn is the main player is also clear in court documents, especially the third one [here](/cases/PeterHaas.html)

The documentary evidence here is overwhelming. Let's run through some of the highlights.

**Wait! That pic of the RioGayGuides page doesn't match what I saw on the page itself.**

Well-spotted. This is suppoosed to be a quick tour, and that's a small detail that is explained elsewhere. [Let me see!](/DNS){: .btn .btn--info}

**So what you're saying is Glenn Greenwald kept his own name off the RioMaleEscorts and RioGayGuides sites, wrote an article under his own name promoting those sites, with David Miranda as a co-author, which said the businesses were operated by a "Curtis Jacobs", yet the sites themselves named the contact as DavidM ?**
{: .text-right}

Yes. The cover-up wasn't very sophisticated, was it?
