title: About Wayback Machine and other archived pages
---

A number of pages on this site are essentially copies of old webpages, with some added contextual information.

The reason we have chosen to include those pages here, rather than merely provide links, is typically because the original page is slow to load, or otherwise awkward to access. By far the most common case is pages sourced from the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org), also known as the *Wayback Machine*.

In these cases we provide some of the following additional buttons for convenience at the top of the page.

- An **Original** button, directly linking to the source.
- An **Archived Orginal** button, linking to the copy of the source archived on the Wayback Machine.
- A **Plain View** button, which links to our own copy of the page, but without the surrounding *Master Notions* template and contextual information.
- A **What's This?** button which takes you <a href="/AboutArchives.html" onclick="alert('Are you expecting that to take you anywhere new?')">here</a>.
