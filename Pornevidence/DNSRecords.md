_Yes, Glenn's first domain name record really did mispell the name of his own company._

# Domain reports

Although a lot of current information is freely available --- some is even necessary for sites to be able to be found --- there is no single definitive source for historical domain information. 

These are the complete reports produced by domaintools.com, a leading commercial provider of historical internet records. In pdf format, they contain fairly complete histories of domain registration, as well as home page screenshots and hosting information.

The most revealing and least anonymous information is often the oldest.  
The 2002 record has HairyStudsVideo.com registered to Werner Achatz at the address of Glenn's own law firm.  
Werner was Glenn's long-suffering significant other at the time, and his name may have  been used to prevent other staff from opening the mail; this is the only reference to his name that we have seen.

HairyStudsVideo was wound down as Studmall took off starting in 2004. The records show Studmall registered to companies controlled by Glenn until at least 2008.  
After that it was controlled by Kink Ink LLC and until 2013 the address was 250, West 54th Street --- the exact same address that the NY Bar currently have listed for Glenn Greenwald.
