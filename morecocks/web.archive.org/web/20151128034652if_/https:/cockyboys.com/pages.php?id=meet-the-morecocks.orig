        <p>RJ Sebastian is director of photography for CockyBoys, as well as the primary photographer for most of the shoots on the website. Jake Jaxson handed him a camera and encouraged him to start shooting the behind-the-scenes candid shots of the models. From there, RJ moved his way up to primary photographer, and has changed the look and feel of the CockyBoys websites images. RJ wants to transform the way pornographic photos are taken and viewed, and feels that you can shoot explicit images that can also live as art and live on their own. He never could have known his potential without the encouragement and support of Jake Jaxson.</p>

        </div>
        <p>When Benny started in the biz seven years ago, he didn't have a lick of programming or design experience. His claim to anything techno-savvy was that he'd heard mention that people had "blogs," this thing called Facebook was the new MySpace, and he had a slight addiction to video games <em>(Elder Scrolls, anyone?)</em>. He first started in the business by uploading porn DVDs to eBay, then managing Studmall.com, starting his own blog BennyMorecock.com, and eventually taking over ownership of CockyBoys with his boyfriends Jake and RJ. After many sleepless nights in front of his computer, lots of Domino's pizza (<em>not</em> Pizza Hut) and 2-liter bottles of Coke, he's now one of the owners and the Chief Technology Officer of CockyBoys.</p>
        <p>Along with Jake and RJ, Benny continues to expand the CockyBoys vision to create a complete entertainment experience.  He wants to carry it beyond the cliché container of the porn genre -- where gay sex can be explored without guilt or shame, and even celebrated.</p>
        <p>When he's not chained to his computer, Benny practices and teaches yoga &amp; meditation, volunteers at a knitting group for blind women, and works with street children in Cambodia. He's an avid knitter, still enjoys video games, and Maker's Mark is the way to his heart. A Brooklynite for eight years, Benny now lives in Westchester with his two boyfriends, six dogs, one cat, a gecko, and formerly a snake that one of the CockyBoys <em>"misplaced"</em> (may he rest in peace). One day he hopes to have a goat. And chickens. Maybe a pig.</p>

So far, he's edited a slapstick reality TV series (<em>RoadStrip</em>), a found-footage documentary and horror film (<em>Fuck Yeah Levi Karter, Meeting Liam 4</em>), and a steampunk fantasy morality play (<em>Answered Prayers</em>), but on his downtime, he enjoys underwater basket weaving. He's also a screenwriter, regular writer, musician, flea market junkie, and cat whisperer.</p>

In 2014 she reprised her role as Levi Karter's dog in Jake Jaxson's new series, <em>Meeting Liam</em>, where she, along with her cast-mates, was nominated for Cybersocket 2016's <em>Best Movie or Web Series of the Year</em> award. After the success of her two films, Bella has taken a short break from acting, and she now resides at her full-time residence in Westchester with her close friend and director, Jake Jaxson.
